* Race the Drifter! is a drift racing app that lets users input the names of drifters they'd like to race.

* Whenever a user submits a drifter's name and car, your app will display the drifter info on the left side of the page -- waiting to be raced.

* Each drifter in the waiting area also has a `Race it!` button. When the user clicks it, the drifter will move to the right side of the page.

* The app will store every drifter in the database, whether raced or not.
